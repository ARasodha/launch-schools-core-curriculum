//- must extend page that you want to insert block from
extends layout.pug
//- Inserting html template code from layout.pug
block appContent
  h1 Hello Express 
  p Practicing Pug 

  //- ATTRIBUTES

  //- Use of anchor tags, setting class
  a(class="button" href="https://google.com") Check us out on Google!

  //- can use javascript when setting attributes
  - var authenticated = true 
  textarea(class=authenticated ? "authed" : "anon")

  //- multiline attributes, boolean attribute
  input(
  type='checkbox'
  name='agreement'
  checked
)

  //- style attributes
  button(style={color: 'red', background: 'green', height: "70px", width: "100px"})

  //- CONDITIONALS- Add javascript logic to determine which elements are used
  if false 
    a(style={color: "red"} href="#") Hello
  else
    a(style={color: "blue"} href="#") Bye

  //- unless keyword can be used like !variable 
  unless false
    p this is the same as (if !false)

  //- class literal - classes can defined using a .classname syntax
  //- here is an anchor tag with the class button, swap . with # for ID
  a.button(href="https://facebook.com" target="_blank") Facebook

  //- CASE -note: if there is an empty line the case will fall through (ex no p element have when 0)
  - var friends = 10;
  case friends 
    when 0: p you have no friends 
    when 1: p you have a friend 
    default: p you have #{friends} friends


  //- CODE

  //- Unbuffered Code - starts with - snd does not directly add anything to the output
  - for (let x = 0; x < 3; x++)
    li item

  //-  pug also supports block unbuffered code:
  - 
    var list = ["uno", "dos", "tres", "cuatro", "cinco", "seis"]
  each item in list
    li= item

  //- Buffered Code - starts with = and evaluates the javascript expression and outputs the 
  //- result. For security buffered code is first HTML escaped. Code that you dont want to be escaped
  //- can use != instead (dangerous, vulnerable to XSS)
  p
    = "This code is <escaped> (&lt;escaped&gt;)!"

  //- buffered comments: 
  // example
  //- unbuffered comments
  //- example
  //- block comemnts
  //- 
    example
    example
    example

  //- DOCTYPE can be written as-->  doctype html
  //- checkout layout for INCLUDES examples

  //- TEMPLATE INHERITANCE - BLOCK & EXTENDS
  include includes/block.pug

  //- INTERPOLATION
  - var title = "Oh dogs: Man's best friend"
  - var author = "enlore";
  - var theGreat = "<b>escape!</b>"

  h1= title
  p Written with love by #{author}
  p This will be safe: #{theGreat}

  p.
    text to show that a file can only extend one other file, otherwise 
    you need to use #[em(style={color: "green"}) include] instead.

  //- ITERATION

  //- each, can also access the index as iterating (each val, index, in [array...])

  ul 
    each val in ['a', 'b', 'c']
      li= val
  
  //- can also iterate over the keys in an object 
  ul 
    each val, key in {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three"}
      li= key + ': ' + val
  
  //- can also add an else block that will execute if the array/object is empty
  - var values = [];
  ul 
    each val in values
      li= val
    else 
      li There are no values

  //- while
  - var n = 0;
  ul
    while n < 4
      li= n++

  //- MIXINS - let you create reusable blocks of pug 

  mixin list 
    ul 
      li foo
      li bar 
      li baz 
  //- use: 
  +list
  +list

  //- mixins are complied to functions so they can take arguments -these li have the class pet
  mixin pet(name)
    li.pet= name
  ul 
    +pet('cat')
    +pet('dog')
    +pet('tiger')
