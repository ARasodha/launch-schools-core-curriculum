// Sentiment Analysis 2
/*
Input: string
Output: string
Rules
- re-implement the sentiment analysis with regex-based positive and negative word lists
- in the previous exercise we didn't count words that were different forms of the words in the 
positive and negative word lists. 
- with a regex-based list of keywords we can search for variations of each word 
ex: fortune -> fortunes, respect -> respected
Algorithm
-

  'Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,\n' +
  'And, by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep-\n' +

  'That flesh is heir to-\'tis a consummation\n' +
  'Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep-\n' +
  'To sleep, perchance to dream. Aye, there\'s the rub,\n' +
  'For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\n' +
  'When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\n' +
  'Must give us pause. There\'s the respect\n' +
  'That makes calamity of so long life.\n' +
  'For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\n' +
  'Th\' oppressor\'s wrong, the proud man\'s contumely, [F: poor]\n' +
  'The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay, [F: disprized]\n' +
  'The insolence of office, and the spurns\n' +
  'That patient merit of the unworthy takes,\n' +
  'When he himself might his quietus make\n' +
  'With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, [F: these Fardels]\n' +
  'To grunt and sweat under a weary life,\n' +
  'But that the dread of something after death,\n' +
  'The undiscovered country from whose bourn\n' +
  'No traveler returns, puzzles the will\n' +
  'And makes us rather bear those ills we have\n' +
  'Than fly to others that we know not of?\n' +
  'Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,\n' +
  'And thus the native hue of resolution\n' +
  'Is sicklied o\'er with the pale cast of thought,\n' +
  'And enterprises of great pitch and moment, [F: pith]\n' +
  'With this regard their currents turn awry, [F: away]\n' +
  'And lose the name of action.-Soft you now,\n' +
  'The fair Ophelia.-Nymph, in thy orisons\n' +
  'Be all my sins remembered';
