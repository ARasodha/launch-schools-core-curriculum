// Practice Problems - Classes
// Exercise 1:
// Explanation: When it is said that classes are first class values that means they can be passed
// to functions as arguments, returned by functions, saved to variables, and stored in object
// just like any other value. (same as a first class functions)

// Exercise 2: 
class Television {
  static manufacturer() {
    // omitted code
  }

  model() {
    // method logic
  }
}
// Explanation: The static modifier ensures that the method is called on is a static method
// that can only accessed through the constructor and not an from an instance of the constructor
